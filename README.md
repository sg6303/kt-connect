Manage and integrate with your Kubernetes dev environment more efficiently.

## Features

* Connect: Directly Access a remote Kubernetes cluster. KT Connect use `sshuttle` as the vpn tool to access remote Kubernetes cluster networks.
* Exchange: Developer can exchange the workload to redirect the requests to a local app.
* Mesh: You can create a mesh version in local host and redirect to your local
* Dashboard: A dashboard view can help you know how the environment is been used.

## QuickStart

You can download and install the `ktctl` from [Downloads And Install](https://rdc-incubator.github.io/kt-docs/#/downloads)

### Deploy a service in Kubernetes

```
$ kubectl run tomcat --image=registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/rdc-product/kt-connect-tomcat9:1.0 --expose --port=8080
service "tomcat" created
deployment.apps "tomcat" created

# Deployment info
$ kubectl get deployments -o wide --selector run=tomcat
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE       CONTAINERS   IMAGES                                                                 SELECTOR
tomcat    1         1         1            1           18s       tomcat       registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/rdc-product/kt-connect-tomcat9:1.0   run=tomcat

# Pods info
$ kubectl get pods -o wide --selector run=tomcat
NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP             NODE
tomcat-54d87b848c-2mc9b   1/1       Running   0          1m        172.23.2.234   cn-beijing.192.168.0.8

# Service info
$ kubectl get svc tomcat

```

### Connect: Access Kubernetes resource from local

```
$ sudo ktctl connect --method=vpn
10:44PM INF Connect Start At 80073
10:44PM INF Client address 192.168.3.120
10:44PM INF Deploying shadow deployment kt-connect-daemon-rarba in namespace default

10:44PM INF Shadow Pod status is Pending
10:44PM INF Shadow Pod status is Running
10:44PM INF Shadow is ready.
10:44PM INF Success deploy proxy deployment kt-connect-daemon-rarba in namespace default

Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:2222 -> 22

Warning: Permanently added '[127.0.0.1]:2222' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
client: Connected.
10:44PM INF KT proxy start successful
```

Access PodIP:

```
curl http://172.23.2.234:8080 #Access PodIP from local
kt-connect demo from tomcat9
```

Access ClusterIP:

```
$ curl http://172.21.6.39:8080 #Access ClusterIP
kt-connect demo from tomcat9
```

Access Server internal DNS address

```
$ curl http://tomcat:8080 #Access Server internal DNS address
kt-connect demo from tomcat9
```

### Exchange: Access local from cluster

Create Tomcat 8 in local and expose 8080 port

```
docker run -itd -p 8080:8080 tomcat:8
```

```
$ sudo ktctl exchange tomcat --expose 8080
2019/06/19 11:19:10  * tomcat (0 replicas)
2019/06/19 11:19:10 Scale deployment tomcat to zero
2019/06/19 11:19:10 Deploying proxy deployment tomcat-kt-oxpjf in namespace default
2019/06/19 11:19:10 Pod status is Pending
2019/06/19 11:19:12 Pod status is Running
2019/06/19 11:19:12 Success deploy proxy deployment tomcat-kt-oxpjf in namespace default
SSH Remote port-forward for POD starting
2019/06/19 11:19:14 ssh remote port-forward start at pid: 3567
```

```
tips:
if your remote port diffrent local port, you can user ${remotePort}:{localPort} set expose parameter
```

Access the local tomcat by internal service DNS address:

> Note: if `ktctl connect` not running, you can only access from cluster

```
$ curl http://tomcat:8080 | grep '<h1>'
<h1>Apache Tomcat/8.5.37</h1> #
```

### Mesh: Build large test environemnt with ServiceMesh

> You can know more from [Mesh Best Practices](https://rdc-incubator.github.io/kt-docs/#/guide/mesh)

The biggest difference from mesh and exchange is exchange will scale the origin workload replicas down to zero, and mesh will keep it and create a pod instance with an random version. After this, user can modify the `Istio` route rule to let the specific request redirect to your local, and the environment can keep working as normal:

```
$ sudo ktctl mesh tomcat --expose 8080
2019/06/19 22:10:23 'KT Connect' not runing, you can only access local app from cluster
2019/06/19 22:10:24 Deploying proxy deployment tomcat-kt-ybocr in namespace default
2019/06/19 22:10:24 Pod status is Pending
2019/06/19 22:10:26 Pod status is Pending
2019/06/19 22:10:28 Pod status is Running
2019/06/19 22:10:28 Success deploy proxy deployment tomcat-kt-ybocr in namespace default
2019/06/19 22:10:28 -----------------------------------------------------------
2019/06/19 22:10:28 |    Mesh Version 'ybocr' You can update Istio rule       |
2019/06/19 22:10:28 -----------------------------------------------------------
2019/06/19 22:10:30 exchange port forward to local start at pid: 53173
SSH Remote port-forward POD 172.16.0.217 22 to 127.0.0.1:2217 starting
2019/06/19 22:10:30 ssh remote port-forward exited
2019/06/19 22:10:32 ssh remote port-forward start at pid: 53174
```

### Dashboard

The dashboard can help your know how your dev environment is been used.
